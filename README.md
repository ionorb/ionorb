👋 Hi there! I'm a student at École 42, known for its unique, hands-on, project-based learning approach to programming.

🛠️ Project Experience: My time at École 42 has been filled with a wide array of coding projects that simulate real-world challenges. From low-level system utilities to high-level applications, these projects have provided a strong foundation in software development in C and C++.

🤖 Side Passion for AI: While École 42 has furnished me with a broad programming skill set, I've taken the initiative to delve into the world of artificial intelligence on my own. I've focused on model training techniques and am fascinated by the challenges and possibilities it presents.

🖥️ GPU Programming: Alongside AI, I've ventured into GPU programming, familiarizing myself with CUDA to optimize computational tasks. One of my noteworthy projects involved building a raytracer using GPU programming. Utilizing CUDA, I was able to significantly accelerate rendering times, blending my interests in high-performance computing and graphical applications. This combination of AI and high-performance computing has been a personal focus that I'm eager to apply professionally.

🔍 I'm actively seeking internship or junior-level opportunities to leverage my project experience and specialized interests in AI and GPU programming.

🤝 Let's connect to discuss how my blend of formal education and self-guided learning can bring value to your team!
